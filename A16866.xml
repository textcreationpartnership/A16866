            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

That which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to the bringing of them to open light, was not any priuate or ſiniſter reſpect, but mature and
<pb facs="tcp:18343:3"/> aduiſed deliberation. Firſt, I obſerued the great neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of thoſe two maine duties, of meditation, and prayer; how farre moſt were from the daily prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thereof, how much vnacquainted therewith; then which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nothing ſhould bee more ordinary with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. I heard oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the ſcantnes of writings of this nature, as much as of ſuperfluitie in others: yea, euen our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries haue not ſpared to faſten this as a reproch vnto our profeſſion and religion, though indeede they haue leaſt cauſe to
<pb facs="tcp:18343:3"/> complaine of vs (what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſoeuer they may ſeem to haue) ſeeing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of their labours herein, is farre from that holy exerciſe of true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, ſauouring in many things too much of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and carnall affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not that onely, but alſo (as may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to thoſe that are of ſound iudgement, &amp; right diſcerning) exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue in the main points, and maimed in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts, euen in thoſe which ſhould bee the very life of deuotion. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered alſo how neceſſarie it was for men to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:18343:4"/> helps and furtherances at hand, whereby they might bee inured to the due and frequent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this dutie, ſo requiſite for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of that drines of hart, and that deadnes of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is oftentimes in the beſt, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying of that ſpirituall diſtemper, which not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth preuaile too much with them, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe are well diſpoſed, &amp; deſire to approoue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the Lord in truth and ſinceritie; as alſo for the quickening of the fainting ſoule, and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſpirits, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Beſides (that which more nearly concerned me) I remembred how God hath placed all men in the world for a time, not to be idle and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but to be helpful and ſeruiceable vnto others whiles they liue by what meanes they can; yea how ſtraitly euery one is bound to imploy any talent that God hath betruſted him withall, during his life here vpon earth, vnto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to the benefite of
<pb facs="tcp:18343:5"/> others, leſt when the day of accounts ſhall come, he be found blame-worthie, and ſo depriued of the ioy of his maſter, euen the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that celeſtiall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the loſſe whereof can neuer be recompenſed with the greateſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the fading plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and fruitles vanities of this alluring and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world. I ſaw alſo how faſt my dayes did ſlide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a ſwift foot, and how the harbingers of death had oft ſummoned me to my laſt end, &amp; giuen me warning to prepare for his comming; yea how my candle was much ſpent
<pb facs="tcp:18343:5"/> whiles I had giuen but little light vnto others;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccle.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 115.17.18.</note> and thought vpon that of the wiſeman, that there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the graue whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was going, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſt euery houre; and therefore conſidering oft and ſeriouſly with my ſelfe the ſhortnes &amp; vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of my fading life (the line wherof God of his mercie and goodnes hath drawen out longer, then I either did or could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto my ſelfe) I was deſirous that this ſhort courſe of mine, might not be without profite, but that
<pb facs="tcp:18343:6"/> according vnto that poore talent which the Lord hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, I might in any ſort be beneficiall vnto the leaſt of the ſaints of God, and be a meanes of ſpiritual good vnto any, though not in ſuch maner as thoſe whom God hath inabled for greater perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. This it was that preuailed with me, and at length moued me (beeing alſo moued thereunto by ſome, who hauing intereſt in me, made me more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this buſineſſe) to publiſh that for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of others which I had firſt vndertaken for mine owne priuate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe;

Firſt, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you haue bin ſo well ſeaſoned in your younger yeares by meanes of the religious and godly care of your worthie parents (who as while they liued, they were lights vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo now being dead, and at reſt with the Lord, their example may well be a paterne and preſident
<pb facs="tcp:18343:7"/> vnto thoſe of that ranke and order) I might hereby ſtirre vp your pure minde, in this your riper age, vnto the daily exerciſe of thoſe duties, which were ſo vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ordinarie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as doubtleſſe they haue left few behinde them, who deſerue the like praiſe herein. As the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance hereof may be a ioy and comfort vnto you; ſo the imitation of the ſame wil be comfortable and exceeding profitable both vnto your ſelfe and others. Againe, I was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en hereunto in priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; both in regard of that ancient frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip firſt
<pb facs="tcp:18343:7"/> begun, whiles we liued in the ſame Colledge, vnder the ſame gouernment; as alſo of that kindnes which you haue ſince ſhewed me, and which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to make acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of, I thought good to take this occaſion.

Alas, the daughters of ſinging are now abaſed; he is almoſt paſt hearing, and though he could heare it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo well, yet it would not be any refreſhing vnto him, he could not ſolace himſelfe in it; yea rather it would

His pleaſures, profits, or great reuenues in this world? neither can theſe comfort him in that houre, they will not afford him any true ioy, pleaſure or delight; no though he might euen ſwimme and bathe himſelfe in the abundance of them: yea rather they would be a trouble vnto him, they would diſquiet &amp; diſtract his mind, both becauſe he now ſeeth that he is preſently to leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer, &amp; to giue a finall farewell vnto them, neuer to haue any vſe or benefit of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

What then would be moſt ſweete and pleaſant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? What would moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him, and cheere vp his languiſhing ſpirit? In briefe; if thou ſhouldeſt aske him, what was his comfort in this extremity, wherein he found moſt ioy and delight: would he not anſwere thee, that his reioycing was the teſtimonie of his owne conſcience, euen in this, that he had endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe, with Paul, to haue alway a cleare conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce toward God, and men? in this that he had laboured with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18343:76"/> Henoch to walke with God al his life long: in this, that it was his chiefe care co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, to liue vprightly, and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God, and blameleſly and innocently before men. Would he not tell thee, that this was the thing wherin he reioyced, wherewith he was comforted? Surely without doubt he would. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: For this, this (the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I meane of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) would then be as a delightſome feaſt, &amp; a moſt heauenly banquet vnto him. It would be ſweete muſicke, and a pleaſant melodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Neuer did he taſt of ſuch iuncats, as theſe would be to his hungry ſoule, and to his fainting ſpirits. It would be as it were Manna from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and water of life, out of
